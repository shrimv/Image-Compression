# Image-Compression
This is jupyter notebook outlining the details on how to natively compress .jpeg files. 2-D fast fourier transforms are implemented to encrypt pixels, remove unecessary noise, and decrypt the signals.
Ratios can be specified and "before and after" for compressed jpegs are illustrated, a very cool project that helped me learn more about one of the greatest algorithms of the last 500 years.
